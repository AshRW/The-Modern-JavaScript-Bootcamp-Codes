# The-Modern-JavaScript-Bootcamp-Codes
This Repo has my practice code for the course "The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp" from Udemy. The repo contains solutions of challenges asked throughout the sections of the course.

# How to Run
You'll need Node if you want to run it outside of the browser in a cmd or any terminal. Else you can run the script in a browser but you'll have to pull out the console to see all the logs
